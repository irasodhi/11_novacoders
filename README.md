# EcoHarvest – Green Grid for Sustainable Farming

## Problem Statement
Farmers and home gardeners often lack proper guidance, access to organic resources, and reliable information for sustainable farming practices. Excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides harms soil health, water resources, and the environment. There is a need for a digital platform that connects people, knowledge, and organic resources to promote environment-friendly farming.

## Proposed Solution
EcoHarvest is a web-based green platform designed to promote organic and sustainable farming. It provides an AI-powered chatbot for plantation guidance, crop-specific cultivation steps, and organic farming practices. The platform also connects farmers and gardeners with verified organic seed sellers, creating a digital green ecosystem.

## Objectives
- Promote organic and sustainable farming practices  
- Reduce dependency on chemical fertilizers and seeds  
- Provide easy farming guidance using AI chatbot  
- Connect farmers, gardeners, and organic seed sellers  
- Support environmental protection and food sustainability  

## Key Features
- **AI-based crop and plantation chatbot** – Real-time guidance for crops and plantations.  
- **Crop and plant search** – Step-by-step cultivation instructions.  
- **Organic seed seller–farmer connection** – Connect with verified organic seed suppliers.  
- **Home gardening and terrace farming support** – Guidance for small-scale sustainable farming.  
- **Climate-aware crop recommendations** – Crop suggestions based on climate and environment.  
- **Seed Marketplace** – Users can browse products added by the admin.  

## How It Works

### User Workflow
1. Users can register and log in to EcoHarvest.  
2. Users can browse products in the **Seed Marketplace**.  
3. When a user buys a product, the request status initially shows:  


### Admin Workflow
1. Admin can log in using:  
- **Username:** `admin`  
- **Password:** `admin123`  
2. Admin can view all pending user requests for product purchases.  
3. Admin can either **Approve** or **Reject** requests.  
4. Once approved:  
- User sees **Request Approved**  
- User sees that the **Product will be Delivered**  
5. Admin can also **add new products** to the Seed Marketplace.  
6. Users can see newly added products immediately after admin adds them.  

### Example
| User Action | Status Shown |
|-------------|--------------|
| Buys a product | Waiting for Admin Approval |
| Admin approves | Request Approved → Product Delivered |
| Admin rejects | Request Rejected |

## Conclusion
EcoHarvest aims to build a scalable green digital ecosystem that empowers farmers and individuals to adopt organic farming. By combining technology with environmental responsibility, the project promotes a healthier environment, sustainable agriculture, and easy access to organic resources.
